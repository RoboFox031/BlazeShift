Thoughts throughout the Project:
	This project has been interesting in its entirety. As the Project Manager with a great team my job was fairly easy
	for the entirety of the project. Our team was almost always on task and I could also trust that work would get done at
	home or some other productive times. This allowed the group to be able to have fun and take breaks regularly. Throughout the 
	project I mostly only worked with 2D art and animation. This allowed me grow in my art skills and learn how to satisfy 
	requests for my team when something art related was needed. 
Difficulties:
	Some difficulties could be the time it takes for me to make a sprite. It is often a tedious process when doing 
	animation and also takes a long time when trying to make sure the proportions are how I would like them. The biggest 
	set back is often the plan to get the art done on a school night but commonly being interrupted with extra studies 
	for AP classes and other surprising homework I may have. 
Surprises:
	I was fond of how well I was able to get with some of my pixel art skills throughout the project and I happy with the 
	amount that all of the members were able to do. The game is even better than what I could've imagined at the start of the 
	project. 
Lessons:
	I learned that with a lot of practice you can always get better at something. I also learned that if your skills don't
	align with a task or project you can still find ways to use what you are good at to help a team and improve the project
	overall. I learned that I really enjoy doing art and it is a potential career path for me.
