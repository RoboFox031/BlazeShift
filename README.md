 Template Repo for building Godot Games for the FCHS Arcade Cabinet
Our Project is an Arcade Racing Game that allows 2 players to compete head to head in an exciting automobile clash with
weapons and various vehicles. The pixelated world takes the player back to a more retro style with many retro cars to choose
from. In which the player's success and skill will pay off to allow them purchase more cars and upgrade owned cars to have a
better chance to win! These players will have to test their racing skills and decision making skills when choosing the best 
car and upgrades when bettering their chance to win. There will also be weapons in mystery boxes to spice things up.
