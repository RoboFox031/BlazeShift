Project Description:
Our Project is an Arcade Racing Game that allows 2 players to compete head to head in an exciting automobile clash with
weapons and various vehicles. The pixelated world takes the player back to a more retro style with many retro cars to choose
from. In which the player's success and skill will pay off to allow them purchase more cars and upgrade owned cars to have a
better chance to win! These players will have to test their racing skills and decision making skills when choosing the best 
car and upgrades when bettering their chance to win. There will also be weapons in mystery boxes to spice things up.

OOP Concepts and Godot Features:
	Abstraction- When do we do the first one?The picups class has varibles that are needed by its children.
	Encapsulation- All of our logic in most scripts is organized, private varibales and functions can be found in the shop and upgrade shop.
	Inheritance- Almost every unique node in our project is a class. The cars, pickups, powerups, and maps all use parent classes and parent logic. The maps overide parent logic in order to change where the player spawns.
	Polymorphism- Polymorphism is used primarily when updating the car. The "is" keyword is used when the player collides with a coin or powerup box in order to varify that a player is the one colliding. The car has functions for updating its position that uses the object type of checkpointIDK what the last requirement wants is asking???
	Shaders- We have a shader in the game 
	Resources- All of the car stats are stored in resources.
	Custom Signals- The terrian is one instance in where custom signals are used.
